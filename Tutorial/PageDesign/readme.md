# Tutorial: How to write requirement to your application Page Design in Dev Automaton

## Overview
This guide outlines the process of designing application pages, specifying requirements, and configuring UI elements using our development platform.

## Page Design
Page design involves defining requirements and specifications for each page of your software or application. Each page represents actual requirements, and the design process involves:

1. **Editing the Project:**
   - Access the project and navigate to the pages grid.
   - Click on the "Add Page" button to define a new page and enter basic details.

2. **Selecting Page Layout:**
   - Choose a layout for the page, representing its fundamental structure.
   - Custom layouts can also be added based on specific requirements.

3. **Filling Page Sections:**
   - After selecting a layout, fill in the sections with required items such as headers, buttons, and titles.
   - Elements or groups of elements (forms, popups, etc.) can be added to the layout.

## Adding Element Groups
Element groups serve as containers for one or more elements, facilitating organization. To add a group:

4. **Adding a New Group:**
   - Click on "Add New Group" and specify the group name.
   - Optionally, associate a business object with the group.
   - Choose the group type from options like forms or popups.

## Adding Page Elements or UI Controls
Page elements or UI controls (e.g., textboxes, dropdowns) can be added to pages for user interaction:

5. **Adding a New Element:**

   - Click on "Add New Element" and specify the element name.
   - Select the desired UI control and configure its details as needed.

## Adding Events to UI Controls
Events can be added to UI controls to define their behavior:

6. **Adding Events:**
   - In the UI control edit popup, navigate to the events grid.
   - Click on "Add New Event" to define events like change, click, etc.
   - Describe both business requirements and technical specifications for each event.

## Live Preview
Preview pages to visualize the design and interactions:

7. **Previewing the Page:**
   - Expand the Preview section and click "Preview" to interact with the live preview.
   - Export the file if needed.
   - Modify layout styles as required by editing the page.

## BRS & Document Section
Document overall page requirements and attach relevant documents:

8. **BRS & Document Section:**
   - Write and document the overall requirements of the page.
   - Attach necessary documents for reference.

## API Design
Define API technical flows for future reference:

9. **API Design:**
   - Specify API actions and behaviors.
   - Generate source code against APIs as needed.
